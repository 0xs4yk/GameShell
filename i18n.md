Internationalisation of GameShell
=================================

We rely on the GNU tool for internationalisation: `gettext`.

Internationalisation of missions
--------------------------------

All parts of mission source files that are subject to translation (be
they strings, file names, etc.) must only appear either as:
- `gettext STRING` where `STRING` does not mention variables, or
- `eval_gettext STRING` with all dollars in `STRING` **escaped with a
  backslash symbol**.

### Translation files

A language is specified using a strings `language[_territory]` (e.g.,
`fr` denotes French, `en_GB` denotes British english, etc.).

To translate a mission for language string `LG`, a mission directory
should contain the following files:
- a file `locale/LG.po` created from the template `locale/template`,
- a file `goal/LG.txt` giving a translation of `goal/en*.txt`.

### Template generation

To generate the translation template for a mission, run the following
commands in the directory of the mission.
```sh
mkdir -p locale
xgettext --omit-header -o locale/template *.sh
```
You may need to also add other source files (typically binary files)
as argument to `xgettext`.
