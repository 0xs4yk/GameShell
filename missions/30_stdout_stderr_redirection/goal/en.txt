Mission goal
============

Merlin has turned crazy... He paces around the observatory 
tower and mumbles incoherently.

You need to make sense of this because he is the only one 
who knows the secret key!

Hint: it is likely that Merlin's message is riddled with errors...


Useful commands
===============

  ./FILE
    run an executable file as a program. Needless 
    to stay the Merlin is executable...

  CMD  >  FILE
    send standard output (STDOUT) for the command 
    to a file
    (The file is overwritten.)

  CMD  2>  FICHIER
    send error output (STDERR) for the command 
    to a file
    (The file is overwritten.)

  CMD  <  FILE
    send the file to the standard input (STDIN) of 
    the command
