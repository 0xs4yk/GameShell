Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spellbooks are kept in his office, 
in the library. You need to save a list of all 
those spellbooks (and nothing else) in a file 
called "list.txt", in the drawer...


Useful commands
===============

  CMD  >  FILE
    the output of the command is sent to the file 
    instead of being printed on the standard output 
    (the screen)

  less FILE
    display the content of a text file, one page 
    at a time
    Important keybindings are
      Space     scroll down one page
      q         quit
      / STRING  search the string in the file
      n         go to the next occurence of the 
                last search string
