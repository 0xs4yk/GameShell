Mission goal
========

By the way, I think that all these ornements in the 
castle entrance would very much suit my hut. Likewise,
I cannot remove them from here. I would like a copy of
these ornements in my hut.

Reminder
===================

  <*>
  <?>

    the "*" character is a wildcard for any string 
    of character

    the "? character is a wildcard for any character

    in a file name, they are automatically replaced
    by the list of all matching files

    for instance, if the folder contains
        File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    then
      *     -->  File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
      *1    -->  File-1 Folder-1
      *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
      x*    -->  error, no matching file
      *-?   -->  File-1 Folder-1
      *-??  -->  file-14
