Mission goal
============

By the way, I think that the ornaments in the castle's
entrance would very much suit my cabin. Likewise, I
cannot just remove them for here. I would like to have
a copy of these ornaments in my cabin.

Reminder
========

<*>
<?>

  the "*" character is a wildcard for any string 
  of character

  the "? character is a wildcard for any character

  in a file name, they are automatically replaced
  by the list of all matching files

  for instance, if the folder contains
      File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
  then
    *     -->  File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    *1    -->  File-1 Folder-1
    *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
    x*    -->  error, no matching file
    *-?   -->  File-1 Folder-1
    *-??  -->  file-14
