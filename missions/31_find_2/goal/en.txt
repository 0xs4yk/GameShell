Mission goal
============

look for the ruby in the maze, and move it to your chest

NOTE: the filename does not contain the chaine "ruby".
You need to look for a __file__ (instead of a directory), 
and check that the file contains the chaine "ruby".


Useful commands
===============

  find
    search files from the current working directory

    conditions on the file may be added about filenames, 
    size, modification date, etc.

    An interesting condition is
      -type TYPE

  cat FILE
    output the content of the file on the screen

  man CMD
    to read the manual for command CMD

    Here are the main keybindings in manual pages:
        q           quit
        Space       scroll down one page
        / STRING    search for string
        n           go to next occurence of previous
                    search string
