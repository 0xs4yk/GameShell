Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spell books are kept in his office, in the library. You 
need to output a list of all the spell books containing the 
incantation "pq" (or "Pq", or "pQ", or "PQ").

Some of those spell books are locked, and you are not allowed to 
consult them. You need to ignore them.

NOTE: only the list of spell books is required. The incantation 
should not be printed on the screen.


Useful commands
===============

Every command can output messages to the screen in two ways:
  - standard printing ("STDOUT")
  - error printing ("STDERR")
By default, both kind of messages are show on the screen.

It is however possible to redirect both of them to files 
independently.

grep STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  search for a string inside a file and print the corresponding 
  lines
  Some interesting options are
    -l : do not print the lines, but only the filenames containing
         the string
    -i : do not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase

CMD  >  FILE
  standard messages (STDOUT) are sent to the file instead of being 
  printed on the screen
  (The file is overwritten.)

CMD  2>  FICHIER
  error messages (STDERR) are sent to the file instead of being 
  printed on the screen
  (The file is overwritten.)

/dev/null
  "virtual" file that acts as a black hole: anything sent to it is 
  ignored
