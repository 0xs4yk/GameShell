Mission goal
============

While wandering around the first floor of the dungeon, 
I stopped in front of some magnificent paintings. I am 
myself fond of fine art.
I would like to get a copy (same name, same content) of 
the oldest painting.


Useful commands
===============

  ls -l
    print the list of files, with many additional 
    information, including last modification date
